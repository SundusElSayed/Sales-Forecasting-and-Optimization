# Sales Forecasting and Optimization

## Project Overview
This project is focused on forecasting sales and optimizing decision-making for improved business performance. By exploring historical data, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, visualizing trends, and applying forecasting models, this project delivers insights into sales patterns and provides a framework for future predictions.

## Repository Structure
The project is organized into multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each addressing a specific aspect of the analysis and modeling process:
- **Sales_Forcasting_Exploration.ipynb**: An exploratory notebook that investigates specific questions and hypotheses to deepen understanding of sales patterns and identify optimization opportunities.

- **Sales_Forcasting_Data_Cleaning.ipynb**: Focuses on data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- **Sales_Forcasting_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: Explores the sales dataset and identifies key variables, trends, and correlations to understand the factors influencing sales.

- **Sales_Forcasting_Data_Visualization.ipynb**: Contains visualizations for key metrics and sales trends to provide insights into seasonality, product demand, and sales by region.

- **Sales_Forcasting_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**: Prepares data for modeling by performing feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features.


- **Sales_Forcasting_Model_Fitting.ipynb**: Applies various forecasting models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning algorithms, to predict future sales and evaluate model performance.


- **Train.csv**: The main dataset used for training models and conducting analyses.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data preparation, including handling missing values and transforming features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis of sales data to uncover patterns and relationships.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual analysis to identify trends, seasonality, and other key sales insights.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implementation of forecasting models to predict future sales and inform business strategies.
- **Optimization Insights**: Data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategy based on forecasting outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for organizing code and documentation
